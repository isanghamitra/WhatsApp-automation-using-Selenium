# WhatsApp-automation-using-Selenium

This is a basic automation project I have created after trying my hands on Selenium. To install Selenium on your Anaconda distribution follow :
       
       $ conda install selenium
       
 For those using pip package follow:
 
       $ pip install selenium

SELENIUM is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. Testing done using the Selenium tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing. Selenium is basically used to automate the testing across various web browsers. It supports various browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Firefox, Safari, and IE, and you can very easily automate browser testing across these browsers using Selenium WebDriver.
